      [Banff Cyber Technologies](https://www.banffcyber.com) is a Singapore-based cybersecurity start-up which provides web
      security solutions for enterprises and small businesses alike. In my 6-month stint at the company, my main focus was on the
      [WebOrion Business SaaS](https://www.weborion.io) Web Application Firewall (WAF).
    - >
      I developed the WAF Research Network, a complete framework in Node.js, PHP and Docker, for deploying, writing and running
      automated false positive and false negative tests against web application firewalls, with a set of almost 250 comprehensive
      WAF tests in various categories such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and inclusion attacks. This included tests against
      popular web applications such as WordPress and OpenCart.
    - >
      I was also involved in planning the architecture for the next version of the WebOrion WAF, utilising various Amazon Web Services (AWS)
      such as SNS and Lambda, taking into account various considerations such as costs, capabilities, ease of development and latency of
      configuration updates. This was followed with implementing a multi-tenant WAF proxy using various technologies such as Docker and OpenResty.
      I also implemented auto scaling and load balancing on AWS, for better fault tolerance, higher availability and reduced operational costs,
      for the WAF proxy to manage sudden surges in traffic.
    - >
      Finally, I implemented the various REST API endpoints and controllers on Laravel that would manage and update each WAF instance's configuration
      on a per-domain basis almost instantly, as well as the UI for the admin portal that would consume this API on Vue.js.
    - >
      Apart from development, I was also involved in performing competitive analysis of costs, price plans and features of the WebOrion
      Security Platform with that of competitors, which culminated in working with the CEO to launch new and more competitive price plans
      in line with the company's strategy.

      I developed a document management system that was used internally within the company. Since the client required
      various custom features not found in popular solutions already available, I wrote the system from scratch in PHP.
      Examples of such features include many-to-many document categorisation, fine-grained access control, version control,
      metadata tagging, user management and LDAP integration.
