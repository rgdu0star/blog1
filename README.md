# [irvinlim.com](https://irvinlim.com)

This is my personal homepage, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages.

Based on some parts of [jekyll-boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/jekyll-boilerplate) and [Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange).

## Development

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for the developer's convenience, which allows Jekyll to be installed via Docker.

```
docker-compose up
```

This will run a Jekyll server in the container and be exposed to the host computer at https://localhost:4000.

## Deployment

*TODO*
