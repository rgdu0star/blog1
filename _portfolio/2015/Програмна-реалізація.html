In NUS, final-year students or Masters-level students often conduct research projects with monetary reimbursements, but they constantly face the problem of low signup rates. Without a proper channel for researchers to get participants, we sought to fill this gap with 1our. By filling in surveys or performing simple tasks, NUS students can earn $10-$20 for each participation, all located within the school campus.

1our aims to bring paid research studies to the rest of the school population in an intuitive and clean layout. Students can sign up or register their interest, which would notify the researcher by email.

This was the final project submission for [CS3216 Software Product Engineering for Digital Markets](https://cs3216.com), taken in AY16/17 Semester 1.

This project also won 2nd Place in the [NUS IDEa$ Challenge](https://nusideas.firebaseapp.com/) 2017, organised by Engineering Design and Innovation Centre, NUS Faculty of Engineering.

The team includes:

- Ng Xu Jie, team lead, marketing and validation
- Kent Nguyen, backend developer
- Leon Mak, frontend developer
- Myself, frontend developer
