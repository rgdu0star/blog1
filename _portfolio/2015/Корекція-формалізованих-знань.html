Ever wondered what's happening near you? Riding on the success of Snapchat, Happ shows you the hottest and most current happenings near your location. Post a Happ, which is either a photo, some text or both, and other users can see, vote and comment on other Happs near them. This was a project submission for [CS3216 Software Product Engineering for Digital Markets](https://cs3216.com).

Happ is fully offline-ready, and uses service workers and HTML5 localStorage APIs, which allows users to browse previously viewed Happs without an active Internet connection, and refreshes the cache once it comes back online.

We ideated and developed Happ as a *Progressive Web Application (PWA)* in the course of roughly 3-4 weeks. The team includes:

- Kent Nguyen, backend developer
- Thien Tran, frontend developer
- Xuan Manh, data and information scraping
- Myself, team lead and frontend developer
